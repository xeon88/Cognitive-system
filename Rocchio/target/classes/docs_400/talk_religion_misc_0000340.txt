Some were fancifully reconstructed from fragments.Get thee to a natural history museum or a library, Mr. Rawlins.  Howdo you explain the nearly complete skeletons of australopithecines andother primal hominids like _Homo erectus_?  _Homo erectus_ wascertainly not an ape, and it definitely was not a modern human either.Consider some of its morphological features: small cranial capacity,supraorbital ridges, receding forehead, sharp angling of the occipitalbone, receding chin, large masseter muscles for chewing, pentagonalskull shape, diastema between incisors and canines, protrudingcanines, shovel-shaped incisors.  _H. erectus_ was bipedal, though.So are these nearly complete skeletons of _erectus_ human?  Or ape?Or fanciful reconstructions?  Have you even seen one?Brett J. Vickers		 "Don't go around saying the world owes youbvickers@ics.uci.edu		 a living.  The world owes you nothing.
