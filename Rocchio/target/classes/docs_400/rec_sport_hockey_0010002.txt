I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasantsurprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, buthe's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish hewere more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade awaythat huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggestdisappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he'sonly a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, thoughnot through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, theaward goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily beMVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of theleague's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewergoals than Hartford. Honorable mentions to Majestic Marty and Warren Rychel.Jon
