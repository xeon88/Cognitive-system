Hi all,I've been locked in a small closet chained to a lab bench for the last week ortwo without access to really important information.  I saw the 3.5 millionshoulder back on the DL--How long is he out for (i.e. How many millions/inningwill he get this year?)  Nothing personal against Higuera mind you, justwondering how Bud can keep coffing up money for him when he lets currentbig producers go over a relative pittance. (Please realize the term "relative pittance" can only be used with sarcasm when discussing baseballsalaries.)Additional questions:  I did'nt get to see Bones pitch this spring--how ishe looking and where is he going to fit in the rotation?How is Surhoff shaping up defensively at third?Are they going to build a new stadium?  When?Tom
