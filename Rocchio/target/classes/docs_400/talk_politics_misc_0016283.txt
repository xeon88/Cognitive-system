It's my understanding that Koresh didn't want to comeout alive, rather to fulfill his own interpretationsof some prophecies.More interesting was discussions on the news about subteranneantunnels under the complex.  Wonder if he was planning on hidingout a few days, then re-emerging "resurrected"?  Sounds a bitlike the book "Passover Plot" to me.  Hmmmmm...
