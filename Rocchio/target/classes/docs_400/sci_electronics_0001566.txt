Iwould like to know which of the pins are inputs, which are outputs,and which are bidirectional (if any - and how the direction isselected).I have found a pinout for the connector:Video Feature Connector Pinouts.Pin     Name   Function1       PD0    Dac Pixel data bit 02       PD1                   bit 13       PD2                   bit 29       -      Dac Clock10      -      Dac Blanking11      -      Horizontal Sync12      -      Vertical Sync13      -      Ground14      -      Ground15      -      Ground16      -      Ground17      -      Select Internal Video18      -      Select Internal Sync19      -      Select Internal Dot Clock20      -      Not Used21      -      Ground22      -      Ground23      -      Ground24      -      Ground25      -      Not Used26      -      Not UsedAnd I assume that pins 1 - 12 are outputs, and 17 - 19are inputs. Is this correct?The reason is this - I have a Rombo Media Pro+ videodigitising card. It chroma keys its output into the vgamonitor signal. However, although it is supposed to workwith an ET-4000 with Hi-colour RAMDAC, the colours on screenbehave as if the top 2 bits of colour information are missing,and red, green, blue signals are swapped around.Rombo has suggested that this may be due to insufficientbuffering on the feature connector outputs, and is happy tosell me a buffer device for 50 pounds.I would rather save about 45 pounds, and build my own. I assumeit would require (for example) a 74F244 buffer IC (or two).Can anyone help? Any information on the feature connector wouldbe highly appreciated!Please could you reply by email :ee90dhg@brunel.ac.ukbecause I am at home (easter holidays) and a 300 baud modemis slow for reading news!
