HELP!!  This morning I turned on my computer..to be greated with a poppingnoise from the monitor.  I quickly looked thru the top right vent and tomy disbelief saw orange flame and smelled smoke!  Great...I opened it up to see what I could see (it's 4 years old, no warrenty for me).On one of the pc boards there was a resistor that had been majorlyfryed..burnt to a crisp..can't even tell what value it is.  This is theonly pjhysical damage I can find.  But to my knowledge, resistors don'tjust randomly blow.  What could have happened??  A voltage regulatorproblem..?  The fuses nearby are intact...great job.  I have 2 thoughts asto why it did this.  One, over the winter I was ruinning a humidifier forabout 6 weeks, although it was halfway across the room.  Could moisturedone this?  I last used it over a month ago.  Second, as most peopledo...I never use the power switches on the CPU or moinitor.  I haveeverything plugged into a surge protector and I turn the whole shebang onwith it.  Now, is this bad???  Should I quit doing it?  Is my systemgetting too much power or varrying power this way when activated?Now...before I take it to a repaoir shop I want to replace the resistor tosee what happens.  But I have no idea what value it is.  Or even if thatwould fix things..would it just blow again??  Right now, when I plug it inand turn it on I don't even get the power LED..a power supply prolem??Should I bother tracking down this resistor value or take it to a shop?? It is resistor R830.  It's near the metal shield thatshgields..something..near a large black electrolytic capacitor.  It's onthe right most pc board.  The monitor is an Imtec 1455N, from mid-1989.Does someone have schematics for this?  Or would someone be willing totake theirs apart and see what value R830 is???  Basically, what the hellshould I do to get this thing fixed for the cheapest amont in the least time.I have crosposted this article.  Please respond via email with any help orsuggestions.  Also, does anyone have Imtecs phone or address??  My manuallacks either from what I can see.  Please respons VIA EMAIL ONLY!!!Needless to say, with no computer I don't have the leisure of scanninggroups while bothering my friend to use his computer/modem.Help..this really bites and I need it working ASAP!!!
