I have looked through the FAQ sections and have notseen a answer for this.I have an X/Motif application that I have written.I have a couple of gif files (or pict) that I havescanned in with a color scanner.  Now I would liketo be able to convert the gif files into a formatthat could be read into my application and displayedon the background of its main window. Preferably withpixmaps, or perhaps as an XImage.I have found functions in the pbmplus program suiteto convert gif to xbm, but that is monochrome, andI really do need color.I have looked at xv, which reads in gif, and writesout several formats, but have not found a way to writeout a file which can be read in as a pixmap.Is there an easy way to do this?email responses preferred.thanks!'markahlenius@rtsg.mot.com===============	regards   'mark  =============================================Mark Ahlenius 		  voice:(708)-632-5346  email: ahlenius@marble.rtsg.mot.comMotorola Inc.		  fax:  (708)-632-2413Arlington, Hts.
