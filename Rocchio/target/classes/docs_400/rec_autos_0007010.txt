Furthermore, the Integra willdefinately outrun the Beretta on the high end.  Car & Driver and Road & trackhave the GS-R doing 136 to 141 mph, and it gets there fast.>     So, the Beretta can out handle the Integra and it can certainly keep>up with it in acceleration.

You can rev that car all day, everyday,and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speakfrom expierence!)I'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when youcomparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is abetter investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  Anddoes a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.NOTE: this isn't a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products.  THe Berretais a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonableprice not to mention, it has an Airbag.  But to start quoting figures from onesource, isn't too reliable.  Read other sources, and drive both cars.  While Ihaven't driven a GTZ, I have driven GTs, and Grand Ams with Quad 4 engines,(so they are similair.)
