For an upcoming project I want to use 4 Megs of DRAM configured as two 2Meg banks of 16 bit data.  I was wondering if anyone out there knows of aDRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if thecontroller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the NationalSemiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I wouldlike to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier toimplement in my circuit.BTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, DallasSemiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM NonvolatizerChip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAMmemory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when thepower is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could usethis chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).Thanks in advance,Wayne Schellekens<schellew@wu2.wl.aecl.ca>Wayne Schellekens, VE4WTS          Internet: schellew@wu2.wl.aecl.caAECL Research                         AX.25: VE4WTS@VE4KV.#WPG.MB.CAN Whiteshell Laboratories        Twisted pair: (204)753-2311 x2317
