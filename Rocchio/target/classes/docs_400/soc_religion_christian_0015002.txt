If you want to look at non-christian sourcestry Alvin Toffler as the perennial optimist.  His views whileblatently non christian explore where technology may be going.>For example, there are some chain letters going>around which claim to have been written by a Christian missionary, but>which present a misleading image of the Christian religion. This is regardless of technology.  Be careful to separate the issues ofrelated to speed and dispersion of technology (how far the letterwent and how quickly it got there) and the message being passed in thetechnology (something that seems to be totally wrong.)>How can we help to make best use of computer technology ?When lecturing in this area I challenge my (non-christan/atheistic) classabout the impact technology has on life, quality of life and the rightsthat they consider important.  Depending on how you work out yourfaith will determine your response to the use of technology.  For examplefriends of mine are considering IVF due to a life threatening situation thewife is going through; when it is over they will have the baby. (Godwilling).  In this case the technology is available and my friends have todecide what to do.  In all cases though you must decide if the technologyis against God's revealed word.Regards DavidDavid Morgan| University of Technology Sydney | morgan@socs.uts.edu.au _--_|\            | Po Box 123 Broadway NSW 2007    | Ph: + 61 2 330 1864   /      \            | 15-73 Broadway Sydney           | Fax: +61 2 330 1807   \_.--._/"I paid good money to get my opinions; you get them for free"                v
