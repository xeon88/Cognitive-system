We're all set to buy one of these for the office, to use for scanning incolor photographs and for optical character recognition.  We've played withthe original grayscale OneScanner and were very pleased.  Is the color modelcomparable in quality?Also, what brand of OCR software would you recommend?  We're leaning towardCaere OmniPage.  Any better ideas?
