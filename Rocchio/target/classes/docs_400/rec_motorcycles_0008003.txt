Whether or not Harley riders|wave to other bikers is one of our favorite flame wars...  I am happy to say that some Harley riders in our area are better than mostthat are flamed about here: I (riding a lowly sport bike, no less) and mygirlfriend were the recipient of no less than twenty waves from a group ofat least twenty-five Harley riders.  I was leading a group of about foursport bikes at the time (FJ1200/CBR900RR/VFR750).  I initiated *some* of thewaves, but not all.  It was a perfect day, and friendly riders despite somebrand differences made it all the better...Randy Davis                            Email: randy@megatek.comZX-11 #00072 Pilot                            {uunet!ucsd}!megatek!randyDoD #0013
