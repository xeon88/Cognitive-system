     Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic fourgame series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader."What could be better," declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubsare challenging?     "It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked," announcedRyne Sandberg.  "If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, orBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able towin.     "Lord, I hope we pull it off."     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, PeteRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cutthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threwto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose tothird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let himbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks thisyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into agap in right-center.  "Cool Papa" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball offand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boonegrounded out to second, ending the threat.       "Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt orTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure onKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spellsRose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able tosustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times."  So came theanalysis from Frank Chance.     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' groundermoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singledhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Kleinsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen poppedout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hittingfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded intoa 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring astrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quickTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced apop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  TheCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To getanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlockplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpenwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead againstLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, drivinghome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler addedanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpenhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 moreruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at onepoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, offRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, butthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  BruceSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in theeighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and wouldconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among theall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their firstfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out offirst in this wacky season.     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled SteveRogers 3-2.  "We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of ourteam speed," remarked Lou Brock.  "I don't see why we can't win thisdivision."     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds ofthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,now 2 back - but in 4th!    "When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in apitcher's park like this," spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  KeithHernandez added that "their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins."  The Pirates have made only26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tendto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshoneSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  WhenNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, thePirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  BertBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessedfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on homeruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by RalphKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in thetop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after MookieWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner onfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with KentTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds inleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcingStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing thePirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulveallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the rightfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who enteredto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deepcenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-parkhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):     Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giantsmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some startingpitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this comingweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while."     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette andthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschelfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homerhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and DonBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott hadone each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday'sdoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of theNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win afterretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, butfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in thefirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as theBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell tothree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced EwellBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rathergood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, thetrade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Ofcourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in theoutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched twohome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and RayNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled SatchelPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game wasscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was workinghis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out andJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled theGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highlyemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in thewide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill inthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  "Normally," Drysdale remarked, "Iwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't affordto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can'tafford to let the Astros beat us."  He then winked and said: "Well, maybeDavis will get decked once."     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) isprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that hiscurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team isa little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo isthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threwtwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware ofthe nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall allaround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  Thefoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,with center field at 420 feet.  "It's as if some three-year-old threw atantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hithome runs'," remarked Roy Campanella.     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalizethe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via theBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded witha two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and theAstros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth toerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatenedto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.     "I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop," he explained.     "How can we do that," Pee Wee Reese wondered.     "They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready tothrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but Iwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go witha shallow infield almost the whole time."     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eightinnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doranpushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second andthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  TheDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as NolanRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  FernandoValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.     "We're mostly a power team," remarked Ron Cey.  "Jackie and, when heplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple otherplays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  Iguess that's why they're so successful there."  Indeed, it seems thatbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Strosswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.
