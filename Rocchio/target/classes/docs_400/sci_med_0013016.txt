The second question is something that's beenknown for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quittingsmoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of theperson who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in theinterim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack perday for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Stillrather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concernedabout heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, andeven a small increase in risk is significant there.=  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   ==  General Internal Medicine      |      "...dammit, not a programmer!  =
