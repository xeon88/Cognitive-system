This past winter I drove from NYC to Killington,VT 6 or 7 times in my1990 325i Convertible (talk about poor reputation in the snow!!)with an EXCELLENT set of snow tires. I put 4 Noika NR10s on in Dec. and have been sure footed in some pretty severe weather conditions ever since. I've plowed through4 - 5 inch snow covered roads effortlessly, while other cars have been paralyzed(front wheel drive included).Concentrate more on "where the rubber meets the road" rather than driveability of carsin snowy conditions. Drive carefully, buy good snow tires, and most cars will performadequately in less than ideal conditions.An aside: I can't praise Noika NR10 snows enough. Absolutely the BEST snow tires I have everdriven on. If you live in the snow belt, do yourself a favor and get a set of thesenext winter. TimTimothy J.
