Is there a single Titan III on order?The problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attemptto market it.  They're basically happy with their government business anddon't want to have to learn how to sell commercially.A secondary problem is that it is a bit big.  They'd need to go aftermulti-satellite launches, a la Ariane, and that complicates the marketingtask quite significantly.They also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong timeto get them started properly.  If memory serves, the pad used for the MarsObserver launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that hadprevented launches from it for a year or so.There have been a few CT launches.  Mars Observer was one of them.  Sowas that stranded Intelsat, and at least one of its brothers that reachedorbit properly.All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry
