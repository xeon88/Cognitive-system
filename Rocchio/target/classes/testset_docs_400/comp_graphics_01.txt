Proud and super thrilled to announce that the slides for our talk “Next Generation Post Processing in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare” in the SIGGRAPH 2014 Advances in Real-Time Rendering in Games course are finally online. Alternatively, you can also download them in the link below.

Post effects temporal stability, filter quality and accuracy are, in my opinion, one of the most striking differences between games and film. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare art direction aimed for photorealism, and generally speaking, post effects are a very sought after feature for achieving natural looking, photorealistic images. This talk describes the post processing techniques developed for this game, which aim to narrow the gap between film and games post FX quality and to help building a more cinematic experience. Which is, as you can imagine, a real challenge given our very limited time budget (16.6 ms for a 60 fps game, which is orders of magnitude less of what can be typically found in films).

In particular, the talk describes how scatter-as-you-gather approaches can be leveraged for trying to approximate ground truth algorithms, including the challenges that we had to overcome in order for them to work in a robust and accurate way. Typical gather depth of field and motion blur algorithms only deal with color information, while our approaches also explicitly consider transparency. The core idea is based on the observation that ground truth motion blur and depth of field algorithms (like stochastic rasterization) can be summarized as:

Extending color information, according to changes in time (motion blur) and lens position (depth of field).
Creating an alpha mask that allows the reconstruction of accurate growing/shrinking gradients on the object silhouettes.
This explicit handling of transparency allows for more realistic depth of field focusing effects, and for more convincing and natural-looking motion blur.

In the slides you can also find our approaches to SSS and bloom, and as a bonus, our take on shadows. I don’t want to spoil the slides, but for SSS we are using separable subsurface scattering, for bloom a pyramidal filter hierarchy that improves temporal stability and robustness, and for shadow mapping a 8-tap filter with a special per-pixel noise A.K.A. “Interleaved Gradient Noise”, which together with a spiral-like sampling pattern, increases the temporal stability (like dither approaches) while still generating a rich number of penumbra steps (like random approaches).

During the actual talk in SIGGRAPH, I didn’t had time to cover everything, but as promised every single detail is in the online slides. Note that there are many hidden slides, and a bunch of notes as well; you might miss them if you read them in slide show mode.

Hope you like them!
