Thanks!I had this problem when I initially installed my sound blaster pro and here'swhat the tech support told me.They told me to look for the files that are stated in the readme file fromthe win31 subdirectory of the soudblaster directory. Now look in the system.inifile and if any of them say device=xxxxxxx.386 than change it to device=*xxxxxxxThats should work. Was your system.ini file erased for some reason? That wouldbe the only reason that I would think that Windoes is giving you the error now.Tony Annese                                    claebaur@shell.portal.com                                          -or- claebaur@cup.portal.com
