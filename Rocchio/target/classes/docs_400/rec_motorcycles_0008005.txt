Re: Waving...I must say, that the courtesy of a nod or a wave as I meet other bikers whileriding does a lot of good things to my mood... While riding is a lot of fun byitself, there's something really special about having someone say to you "Hey,it's a great day for a ride... Isn't it wonderful that we can spend some timeon the road on days like this..." with a gesture.Was sunny today for the first time in a week, took my bike out for a spin downto the local salvage yard/bike shop... ran into about 20 other people who weredown there for similar reasons (there's this GREAT stretch of road on the waydown there... no side streets, lotsa leaning bends... ;) ... Went on animpromptu coffee and bullshit run down to puyallup with a batch of people who I didn't know, but who were my kinda people nonetheless.As a fellow commented to me while I was admiring his bike... "Hey, it's notwhat you ride, it's that you ride... As long as it has 2 wheels and an engineit's the same thing..."maven@eskimo.com (InterNet)         maven@mavenry.altcit.eskimo.com (UseNet)The Maven@The Mavenry (AlterNet)
