Well, I gotta tell ya,last night's Leafs game vs the Devils was a nail-bitter LET ME TELL YOU!It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to theDon and Ron it was the an "off-night" for the Leafs and the Devils were outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ....IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. Hisfast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that hecreated reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of thecredit away from Gilmour).I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY? Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet,Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafsfare when they are once again "healthy" if they are playing this wellso far??Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence,moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lostat home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc.(BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't remember him having any as of yet.)Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norrishas truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago andToronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their lastagainst each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets tosee this one?)Coming to the stretch and still a ROAR'IN!!!!!Go LEAFS Go!!!!*  Alfred (Yong-Jeh) Yim                 *   Toronto wins the  *  4B Mathematics (Actuarial Science)    *     (   ?    )    CUP.*  University of Waterloo, Canada.       *  i like "coca-cola" idea personally*  E-mail: ayim@descartes.waterloo.edu   *
