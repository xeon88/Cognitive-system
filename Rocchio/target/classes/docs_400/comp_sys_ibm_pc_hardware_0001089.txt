Look in Computer Shopper.: They are available fairly cheap. They allow switching between two: serial devices on a single port.Unfortunately the poster wants to use an internal and an external modem so aswitch isn't going to help them.  If you aren't using your com ports foranything else, just define them on different com ports.  Define your internalmodem to be say, com1, and your external modem to be com3.  You reallyshouldn't have to worry about interrupt conflicts since you won't be usingboth modems at the same time :).Christopher Chan-Nui    | Investment in reliability will increase until itchannui@austin.ibm.com  | exceeds the probable cost of errors, or until someone#include <disclaimer.h> | insists on getting some useful work done.
