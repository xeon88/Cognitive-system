Ido not believe that RSA would consent to such.  However, there are other limitation in the concept of RSAREF in whichNSA has an interest.  It has an interest in a limited number ofimplementations, i.e., targets.  It has an interest in fixed key ormaximum modulus size.  It has a legitimate (literally) right to pursue such interests.  Withinbounds, it probably has a right to pursue those interests by covertmeans.  At least it has the same right as the rest of us not to discloseall of its motives and intentions.  (Institutions are not self-aware;they do not know their intentions in any meaningful sense.)William Hugh Murray, Executive Consultant, Information System Security49 Locust Avenue, Suite 104; New Canaan, Connecticut 06840                1-0-ATT-0-700-WMURRAY; WHMurray at DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL
