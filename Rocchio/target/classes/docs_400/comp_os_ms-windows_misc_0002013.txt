I am having a really bothersome problem using the MSDOS prompt in Windows 3.1to open a dos box.  When I am done with the dos box, I cant get back to windows.If I do Alt enter to shrink the box or use 'exit' to close it, the screen goesblack and I have to control-alt-delete until I kill windows.  I get a coupleof screens about app not responding.I think things are still alive under the black screen because if I alt-tabto cycle through the running apps, I get flashes of text but then theblack returns.This persists even if the machine is powered on and off.I am working with an app developed using Borland's 3.1 application frameworksand c++.  It seems to work fine.Hardware is a 486 with 16meg ram; not on a network.  Video is a TSENG vga.  dos 5.0.I reinstalled windows a couple of time but the problem comes back.  I amusing temporary swapping for virtual memory.I would really REALLY appreciate any hints anyone might offer.Thanks,Jim Cant
