Hi.  According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silverdollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates theanniversary of the Stanley Cup.  Now, I know full well what coins areused every day in Canada.  I can easily fish a few out of my pocketchange right now, in fact.  My question is, since the loon is the onlydollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorativecoin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort ofthing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with nochance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, what'sthe current cost and what's its potential value?  Just curious.  If noone knows, I'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (orwhatever it is).
