   Some sick part of me really liked that phrase....   Actually, merely the threat of a *long* prison sentence, even withouta beating, can get most people to give in.  Especially if it's alsopunctuated with a trip to the county jail, where one just happens to getlocked up with all the drunk/stoned/crazy folks that are too violent to beleft in cells with other people....
