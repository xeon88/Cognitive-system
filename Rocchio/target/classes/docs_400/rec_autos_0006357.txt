I am selling my FIAT 850 Spyder:	This sleek little convertable has served me well through my pastyear in San Diego, but I am going away for the summer and I have nowhereto keep it, so on the aution block it goes.	1971 Fiat 850 Sport	White body	White Hard Top (refurbished)	Ivory Convertable Top (refurbished)	New Black interior	Come with high performance exhaust system	Larger rebuilt engine (910 instead of 805)	Car mats	Smog checked, registered until 1994This is the ultimate in San Diego driving. I will not guarantee thatthis car will attract people to you of the opposite gender, but theywill ask for a ride. One warning, this is a high performance ItalianSPORTS car, if you want a boring little set of wheels this is NOT thecar for you, this car requires care. It has a manual choke, a 4-speedmanual transmision, manual throttle control, and even manual wiperpump. If you KNOW how to drive then and only then can you appreciatethis car.Feel free to inquire. The price is $1750 and all inspection has to be inthe San Diego area since school keeps me here all the time.			Quill|-=[ Quill ]=-            |"Have you looked at your hands?
