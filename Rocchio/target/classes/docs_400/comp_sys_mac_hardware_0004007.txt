This model is one of the two low-cost laser printers that Apple justintroduced.  I'm thinking of getting one to use at home.  Have any of youhad any experience with this printer?   Does it have Level-2 PostScript?If you've bought one, are you happy with it?John Cavallino                  |  EMail: jcav@midway.uchicago.eduUniversity of Chicago Hospitals |         John_Cavallino@uchfm.bsd.uchicago.eduOffice of Facilities Management | USMail: 5841 S.
