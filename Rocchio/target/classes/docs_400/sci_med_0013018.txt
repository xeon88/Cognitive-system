Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Takinganything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the ideaof taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects arenot known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be thatin a given situation the risk is worthwhile.   Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic insome cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in usethat long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may havewhen taken over long periods of time, even though it has been testedby present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market becauselong-term effects, if any, are not known?  IMHO, i'd say no.euclid>=  Kenneth Gilbert                |          University of Pittsburgh   =>=  General Internal Medicine    --*--        Pittsburgh, PA             =>=  kxgst1+@pitt.edu               |      "...dammit, not a programmer!  =>=  Kenneth Gilbert                |          University of Pittsburgh   =>=  General Internal Medicine    --*--        Pittsburgh, PA             =>=  kxgst1+@pitt.edu               |      "...dammit, not a programmer!  =Euclid K.       standard disclaimers apply"It is a bit ironic that we need the wave model [of light] to understand thepropagation of light only through that part of the system where it leaves notrace."  --Hudson & Nelson (_University_Physics_)
