I need a device (either an ISA board or a subsystem) which willtake two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template.The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signalone being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior.But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not wantto exclude from my search.  I know this sort of hardware existsfor NTSC, etc. but I need it for RGB.Please email and or post any leads....Gordon Lang (glang@smail.srl.ford.com  -or-  glang@holo6.srl.ford.com)
