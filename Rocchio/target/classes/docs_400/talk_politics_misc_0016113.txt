At any onegiven point the occupants in my vehicles are likely to be armed.I've never had to use my gun, but am prepared to do so if I amattacked.  In essence, I'm quite prepared.  I also have, in the glovebox, my proof of insurance, as mandated by Indiana law.  So, if I gotinto an accident and had to whip out my insurance policy to prove thatI can pay for any damages I may have caused will you "wonder why I'mso prepared for an accident"?
