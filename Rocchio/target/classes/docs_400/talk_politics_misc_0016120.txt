I havesuccessfully defended myself with them.  I have successfully procurredfood with them.  I have successfully had much enjoyment in targetpracticing with them.  In that order firearms are important to me.  Friend, I was raped as achild by an older child who had a knife.  That ain't never gonnahappen again.  There is no one, including yourself, who will *ever*make me a victim again.  As long as you don't try to make me a victim,I will leave you alone.  But if you *ever* try to make me a victim,I'll fight you all the way, such as I'm doing now.  And I'll fight youwith a response appropriate to the situation.  Now, you aren'tadvocating making me a victim are you?  Exactly what are you doing?Anmar Mirza   # Chief of Tranquility  #My Opinions! NotIU's!#CIANSAKGBFBIEMT-D         # Base, Lawrence Co.
