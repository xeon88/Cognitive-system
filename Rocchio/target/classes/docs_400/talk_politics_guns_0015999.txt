His book,: _Firearms_Controls_, has been published in London by Keegan Paul (name: may be misspelled).Others dispute that, like Richard Hofstadter, <America As A Gun Culture>,and Newton and Zimring's <Firearms and Violence in American Life>.  But,again, statistics between too dissimilar cultures are difficult toquantify.I don't know how anyone can state that gun control could have NOeffect on homicide rates.  There were over 250 >accidental< handgunhomicides in America in 1990, most with licensed weapons.  MoreAmerican children accidentally shot other children last year (15)than all the handgun homicides in Great Britain.  (Source: NationalSafety Council.  Please... no dictionary arguments about RATES vsTOTAL NUMBERS, okay?  They're offered for emphasis, not comparison).If Mr. Greenwood believes that Brits are much too sober andcoordinated to make such mistakes I'd like to introduce him to myfriend, Amanda from Brighton.  I used to have some pretty nicecrystal in my place until she moved in.  I've gotten used to thesnide comments from guests about the clown motif on my rubberwine glasses.Stephen Manes					   manes@magpie.linknet.comManes and Associates				   New York, NY, USA  =o&>o
