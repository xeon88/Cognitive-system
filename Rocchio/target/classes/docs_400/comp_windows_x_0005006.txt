Hi, I'm trying to write a Motif program on an Interactive Unix machine, and I'mobserving very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose aDrawingArea. Namely, some Xlib operations work, and some do not. Inparticular, the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by someXDrawPoint calls, and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failingwhenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in therightward direction over the drawing area, but after the move, is still onsome part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when thepulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction.Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a serverbug?Thanks,Zack T. Smith
