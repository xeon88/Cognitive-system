A creationistappears on t.o, makes a completely unsupported statement the facts ofwhich he/she is completely ignorant, is taken to task, and finally replieswith a subtle insult. (actually two insults)Just to make sure I am being fair let's check a few details. Jack, you don'tknow anything about abiogenesis, do you? (this is no sin, I know next tonothing about it either) I mean, anything other than this "10^50" probability thing which you got wrong in the first post.The speculation involved is really your own, isn't it? How much _biology_do you know, even apart from abiogenesis? Any classes past high school?Read Chris Colby's FAQ? How much paleontology, geology, etc do you know?Or are you speculating that its all speculative? Do you have any basisupon which to imply that to keep an "open mind" one must allow thatthe earth, universe, and all the creatures in it could have been created~10,000 years ago? None of this is intended as a flame. To say thatyou don't know a subject is _not_ the same as calling you an idiot. Idon't know _much_ about these areas, but then I am not the onecalling into question all of mainstream science. In other words, wheredo you get off calling it speculative unless by this you also mean thatall of physics, chemistry, etc are also speculative in some sense?You may have, in fact, not been implying that the rejection of creationismis a sign of close-mindedness, or that the theory of evolution is especiallyspeculative, in which case I have merely misinterpretedyou. In this case the worst thing you could be accused of is unclearprose.>JackScottsmullins@ecn.purdue.edu
