Your girlfriend seemsto want to see a counselor, but you don't.  I'd recommend that you examine your hesitation to see a counselor.  It'sa very good environment to examine issues.  The fact of the matter is:  your girlfriend has a different perception thanyou.  The TWO of you need to address the issue in order to resolve it.Please consider going to a counselor with your girlfriend.  What could itpossibly hurt?Cliff  (the paramedic)
