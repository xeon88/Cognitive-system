In thecase of the virgin birth prophecy, it applied to the then and there, andalso prophetically to Christ.  The army that threatened the king would cease to be a threat in a very short time.  Yet it also prophecied of Christ.Several prophecies that refered to Christ also had application at thetime they were made.  "Out of Egypt have I called my Son" refers bothto Israel, and prophetically to Christ.   "Why do the heathen rage"was said of David and also of Christ.  Another example would be the Scripture quoted of Judas, "and his bishopricklet another take."  Another example is something that Isaiah said of Hisdisciples which is also applied to Christ in Hebrews, "the children thouhast given me."How does the preterist view account for this phenomenon.LinkLink Hudson.
