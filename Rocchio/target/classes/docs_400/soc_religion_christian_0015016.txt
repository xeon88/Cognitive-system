My impression has been that Jayne Kulikaskas: usually writes this much less offensive and ludicrous than this. I am not: saying that the offensiveness is intentional, but it is clear and it is: something for Christians to consider.Jayne stands in pretty good company.  C.S. Lewis wrote a whole bookpromoting the idea contained in her first sentence quoted above.  It iscalled "The Final Divorce".  Excellent book on the subject of Heaven andHell, highly recommended.  It's an allegory of souls who are invited, indeedbeseeched to enter Heaven, but reject the offer because being with God inHeaven means giving up their false pride.Joe Kellettjkellett@netcom.com
