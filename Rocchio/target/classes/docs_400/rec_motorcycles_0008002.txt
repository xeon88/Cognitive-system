My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant painin the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that Ifinally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall whereI had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After tellingeveryone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago,signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street,feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and gotthe persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendousracket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  Isaw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance...Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly andsomeone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief witha slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slidup beside me and asked, "Friend of yours, Steve?".  "Shit, Matty,it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!"Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feetbefore letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him.Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick.While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managedto snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twentyminutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Mattypresented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirrorand a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crackand masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy thebike.I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortlyafterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Mattytold me he ran the charge through in December and that it wentuncontested.Stephen Manes					   manes@magpie.linknet.comManes and Associates				   New York, NY, USA  =o&>o
