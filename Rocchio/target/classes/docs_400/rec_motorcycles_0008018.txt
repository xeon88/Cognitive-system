(C).   | 89 SuzukiGS500E - Phaedra ;)Hi, RaviIf you need a Harley, we have lots to spare here. All the yuppiesbought 'the best' a couple  of years ago to pose at the (s)winebar. They 'rode a mile and walked the rest'. Called a taxi home and went back to the porsche. So there's are loads going cheap with about1 1/2 miles on the clock (takes a while to coast to a halt).CheersP.S. You get a better class of people on GS500's anyway
