White, President, Synthesis 93 Inc.# Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A.# Peter.White@mixcom.comThis is rather simple, actually ...Having just been through a revolution, our founding fathers  wellunderstood  the  relationship between We the People and a govern-ment of, by and for the people. They  also  understood  that  anygovernment  of  the People can sometimes grow to become a govern-ment not "by" the People or not "for" the  People.  This  is  howthey chose to handle all of the possibilities:   2nd Amendment   A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a   free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall   not be infringed.This is the ONLY part of the  Constitution  which  gives  us  theright  of  revolution  if  things  seem to be going cockeyed. Allthat's really necessary is an organized march on Washington, justhave everyone bring their arms. Obviously the 2nd is an importantright, a right which many Americans do not fully appreciate.Hope this helps,Ray.Ray.Lampman@FullFeed.Com ,^-_  FullFeed provides public access toFullFeed Communications  L   `; Usenet news and E-mail, plus UUCPMadison, WI 53704, USA   \ .
