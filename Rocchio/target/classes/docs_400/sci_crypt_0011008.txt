I know that factoring and breaking RSA arenot proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not torepeat this every time.I also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group''property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I havethought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that acryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, meansnothing at all.Then I wrote,>Please note that as long as it is much harder to factor a RSA modulus>than it is to generate it, the increase in computer speed alone will>keep key lengths and modulus factoring in lock-step, i.e., people will>simply start using longer moduli and still be safe.What I meant was that as long as the only advantage of thecryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA fora long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could bebroken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then peoplewould simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefitfrom better technology in the same way.Hope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun.Stephan <neuhaus@informatik.uni-kl.de>sig closed for inventory.
