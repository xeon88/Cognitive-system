They may have other patents like this.Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumablyincludes the internal data structure (which has never been officiallydocumented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.I'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal datastructure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or theycame up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then theywon't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files,there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTimemovies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk andtransferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn'tmatter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware,and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.  Whatother patents does Apple have on the Mac?Joe Schwartz       E-mail: xor@acm.rpi.edu  or  xor@clotho.acm.rpi.eduMapInfo Corp.200 Broadway       These are my own opinions.
