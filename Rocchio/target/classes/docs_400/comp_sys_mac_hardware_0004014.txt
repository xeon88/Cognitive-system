	I had asked everyone about problems installing a 4 megsimm and an 8 meg simm in my Centris 610, but the folks at thelocal Apple store called the folks in Cupertino and found thatyou can't have simms of different speeds in one machine, evenif they are both fast enough - ie - My 80 ns 8 meg and 60ns 4meg simms were incompatibable...  Just thought people mightwant to know.....					Jason.
