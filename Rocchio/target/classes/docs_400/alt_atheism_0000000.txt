All characters and events are fictitious.  Any similarity to living or dead gods -- uh, well..."A Canticle for Leibowitz"One gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their livescopying blueprints from "Saint Leibowitz", filling the sheets of paper withink and leaving white lines and letters."Davy"Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example,forbids that anyone "produce, describe or use any substance containing...atoms". Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather thantechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, heremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:"Galactic Pot-Healer"A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to aremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When thedeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright isunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel."A Maze of Death"Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of GnosticChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam ofunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic anddismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters."The Divine Invasion"God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns fromanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must beassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music."The Handmaid's Tale"A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriouslyassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it"right" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to liveunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and theradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punishedretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" arehunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used toat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on."The Bible"This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, itis probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss isabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the onetrue version.                             Books -- Non-fiction"Vicars of Christ", Bantam Press, 1988Although de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a veryenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.(German translation: "Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums",Droemer-Knaur, 1989)"Atheism: A Philosophical Justification", Temple University Press, Philadelphia, USA.A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstandingappendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentiousarea.  Argues both for "negative atheism" (i.e. the "non-belief in theexistence of god(s)") and also for "positive atheism" ("the belief in thenon-existence of god(s)").

Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering Franceand Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New Englanddevelopments.

ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X."The Existence of God (Revised Edition)", Clarendon Paperbacks, OxfordThis book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with "The Coherence ofTheism" (1977) and was concluded with "Faith and Reason" (1981).  In thiswork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for theexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and relyupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values andaesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, weredecisively rejected in Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism".  In the revisededition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which hemakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie."The Miracle of Theism", OxfordThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principalarguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classicalphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, throughthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatementsof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses thosepositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements forGod" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - lessformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly directwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne."Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History of Religious Murder and Madness", Prometheus BooksLooks at religious persecution from ancient times to the present day -- andnot only by Christians.Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 89-64079. 1990."African American Humanism: an Anthology"See the listing for African Americans for Humanism above."An Anthology of Atheism and Rationalism", Prometheus BooksAn anthology covering a wide range of subjects, including 'The Devil, Eviland Morality' and 'The History of Freethought'.
