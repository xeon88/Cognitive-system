This is a periodic posting intended to answer the Frequently AskedQuestion: What is the DoD? It is posted the first of each month, withan expiration time of over a month. Thus, unless your site's newssoftware is ill-mannered, this posting should always be available.This WitDoDFAQ is crossposted to all four rec.motorcycles groups in anattempt to catch most new users, and followups are directed torec.motorcycles.Last changed 9-Feb-93 to add a message from the KotL, and a bit ofHalon.This collection was originally assembled by Lissa Shoun, from theoriginal postings.

That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List(KotL, accept no substitue Keepers) for a number. If you're feelingcreative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you canmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Notthat you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)Oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You'lljust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the wholenet, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.By now you're probably asking "So who's the KotL already?". Well, asJohn Sloan notes below, that's about the only real "secret" left aroundhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John wasthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, theKotL's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirelywith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-oriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen postingmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with "weeniemailers"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being aDead-Head.***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronicallygroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeedwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by gettingsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times ofeconomic activity on the part of the KotL's employers, sending yetanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (itjust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as anexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at leastannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former requestwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you thinkthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).One more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren't whatthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?The typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &e-mail address. For example:0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the onlyrequirements for DoD membership, that's not strictly true these days, asthere are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)Blaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com            "Denizens of Doom", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce's permission]There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal things that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valveseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They argue with each other and plan rides together.The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each other face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world and communicate with each other electronically via computer.The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, rec.motorcycles (pronounced "wreck-dot-motorcycles," it's the file name for the group's primary on-line "meeting place") carries about 2250 articles per month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent posters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred to as the DoD.The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, "Denizen of Doom."  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of the Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of course, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules appealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the List, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Norway and Finland.Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run of 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a few months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were donated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 to the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.As often as possible, the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go riding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California's "Silicon Valley."  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on Rollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California "Joust."The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big barbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern California ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.Though it's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to get together.  Long may they flame."Live to Flame -- Flame to Live"	[centerbar]This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do anything like that face to face.  These insults are known as "flames";  issuing them is called "flaming."  Flames often start when a member disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be something like:  "What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad poseur!"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding ability and your cat.          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011Periodically the question "What is DoD?" is raised. This is one ofthose questions in the same class as "Why is the sky blue?", "If thereis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?" and "Why dowomen inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before theydump you?", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussionby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in thehalls of academe for generations. A long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a fewminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) ona computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; twomachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one anothervia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (butwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire ofthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, andsigned it "The Denizen of Doom". Not wishing to identify himself, heasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of timebecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whitabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinkingindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. He who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this wasthe funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is prettyeasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of DoomMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membershipnumber. Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of amotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand ormake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organizedelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become apart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, agestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than thesum of its parts.  It could also be that we're all computer nerds whowear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happento also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weightratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be openminded enough to accept us as members. In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of DoomMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members havenever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yetfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given someof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organizedand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through thenetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in thesame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulatingaround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 anddistributed on VHS by #18)! Where will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board enginemanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where eachparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminalroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. The DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than netaccess and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need onlyask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the fewreally good club secrets). New members will receive via email amembership number and the latest copy of the membership list, whichincludes name, state, and email address. The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at leastuntil next year when we may decided to change the name).

TerribleBarbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane toReverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection: Terrible: This Hopalonga is the greatest... Beats BMWs dead!! Muck: I don't mean to preach, Terrible, but lighten up on the BMW     crowd eh?  I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer     11 but what the heck.  Stompin: No way, the BMW is it, complete, that's all man.Terrible: Nahhhh, you're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack! Hey, at     least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor!     Not as good as a Puff-a-cane, should have been called a     Woosh-a-stream.Stompin: You mean Wee-Stream.Terrible: Waddya going to do? Call in reinforcements???Stompin: Yehh man. Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech. Let's see     what they say, eh? Muck: Now men, let's try to be civil about this.High Tech: Hi, I'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest.Arlow: Other than my B.T. I love my BMW!Terrible: B.T.???Arlow: Burley Thumpison, the greatest all American ride you can own.Muck: Ahhh, look, you're making Terrible gag.Terrible: What does BMW stand for anyway??? Muck, Arlow, High: Beats Me, Wilhelm.Terrible: Actually, my name is Terrible. Hmmm, I don't know either.Muck: Say, here comes Chunky Bear.Chunky: Hey, Hey, Hey! Smarter than your average bear!Terrible: Hey, didn't you drop your BMW???Chunky: All right eh, a little BooBoo, but I left him behind. I mean      even Villy Ogle flamed me for that! Muck: It's okay, we all makes mistakes.Out of the blue the West coasters arrive, led by Tread Orange withDill Snorkssy, Heritick Ratatnack, Buck Garnish, Snob Rasseller andthe perenial favorite: Hooter Boobin Brush! Heritick: Heya Terrible, how's yer front to back bias?Terrible: Not bad, sold yer BMW?Heritick: Nahhh.Hooter: Hoot, Hoot.Buck: Nice tree Hooter, how'd ya get up there?Hooter: Carbujectors from Hell!!!Muck: What's a carbujector?Hooter: Well, it ain't made of alumican!!! Made by Tilloslert!!Muck: Ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!Dill: Well, where do we race?Snob: You know, Chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't     ride! Muck: No! No! Quiet!Tread: BMW's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.     They even have luggage made by Sourkraut!High: My 9 too!Terrible, Heritick, Dill, Buck: Nahhhhh!!!Stompin, Tread, High, Chunky, Snob: Yesss Yessssss!!!Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up morecohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and theinfamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin! Polyanna: Well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like     I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special. Helpful for getting     it up on the ole ventral stand!  Terrible: Hopalonga's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka's and     Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too! Booster: I hate Cavortin.Booster: I love Cavortin.Muck: Well, what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras?Snob, Tread: Nawwwwww.Muck: What about a Tridump?Terrible: Isn't that a chewing gum?Muck: Auggggg, Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity?Heritick: Heyya Muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?Muck: No, no. There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make.Two more riders zoom in, in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter.Pill: Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.Phalanx: Hey, I don't know about that.And Now even more west coasters pour in.Road O'Noblin: Hopalonga's are the greatest!Maulled Beerstein: May you sit on a bikejector!Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:Kite Lanolin: Hey, BMW's are great, men.Robo-Nickie: I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.More riders from the west coast come into the discussion:Aviator Sourgas: Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.Guess Gasket: Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison.With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. Itwas none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn. Clean: Like look, Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns. Muck: Why??Clean: Well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.Muck: But I only have a 4-banger.Clean: No GOOD!Chunky: Sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!Clean: Inferior!Stompin: Hey, look, here's proof BMW's are better. The Bimmer-Boysburst into song: (singing) Beemer Babe, Beemer Babe give me athrill... Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Wadddoes BMW stand for? Heritick, Stompin, Snob, Chunky, Tread, Kite, High, Arlow: BEAT'S ME,Road, Terrible, Polyanna, Maulled, Dill etc.: Oh, don't you mean BMW? And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and thethunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple (G.M.D.) of them allboomed out.G.M.D.: Enough of your bickering! You are doomed to riding     Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. All: no, No, NO!!! Puhlease.Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be ridingmini-trikes?  Are our arguing heros doomed?

Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video                by Jonathan E. Quist   DoD #94[Scene:  A sterile engineering office.  A lone figure, whom we'll callChuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] (editor's note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had atthe First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizensreferring to each other as "Chuck". I guess you had to be there. Iwasn't.) Chuck:  I didn't want to be a Software Systems Analyst, cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir, may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted to live a man's life,[Music slowly builds in background] riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes and the deepest valleys, living the life of a Motorcyclist; doing donuts and evading the police; terrorizing old ladies and raping small children; eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  In short,	I Want to be      A Denizen![Chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (withfringe), boots, and cap.  Scene simultaneously changes to the top ofan obviously assaulted Rollins Pass.  A small throng of Hell's Angelssit on their Harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oilon the tarmac.  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed FatBoy.] Chuck [Sings to the tune of "The Lumberjack Song"]:I'm a Denizen and I'm okay,I flame all night and I ride all day.[Hell's Angels Echo Chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:He's a Denizen and he's okay,He flames all night and he rides all day.I ride my bike;I eat my lunch;I go to the lavat'ry.On Wednesdays I ride Skyline,Running children down with glee.[Chorus]:He rides his bike;He eats his lunch;He goes to the lavat'ry.On Wednesdays he rides Skyline,Running children down with glee.[Chorus refrain]:'Cause He's a Denizen...I ride real fast,My name is Chuck,It somehow seems to fit.I over-rate the worst bad f*ck,But like a real good sh*t.Oh, I'm a Denizen and I'm okay!I flame all night and I ride all day.[Chorus refrain]:Oh, He's a Denizen...I wear high heelsAnd bright pink shorts, full leathers and a bra.I wish I rode a Harley, just like my dear mama.[Chorus refrain]                    Why you have to be killed.Well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managedto read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the DoD startedas a joke. And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.Sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: "What does DoDstand for? It's not the Department of Defense is it?" Naturally, aDenizen who had watched the movie "Top Gun" a few times too many roseto the occasion and replied:"That's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you."And the rest is history.A variation on the "security" theme is to supply disinformation aboutwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, whereknown) include:Daughters of Democracy (DoD 23)		Doers of DonutsDancers of Despair (DoD 9)		Debasers of DaughtersDickweeds of Denver			Driveway of DeathDebauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of DirtbikesNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to belimited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.                     The rec.moto.photo archiveFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and ChuckRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish inunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriatefor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has notonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has takenthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.Not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawkat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from theserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,the general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about howto use the archive.Via ftp:cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]Via e-mail:The address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of themessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  Thearguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  Forrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:dir [dod]send [dod]bruce_tanner.gifsend [dod]dodframe.psand you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded partsof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.Oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up tothe next whole file) are send.  A 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of50K each; not a good idea.Bruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDUCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tannerA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, sowhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?Second, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kindof you to access it after normal working hours (California time).                       Patches? What patches?You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &pins. And your reaction was probably: "I want!", or "That's sick!", orperhaps "That's sick! I want!"Well, there's some good news and some bad news. The good news is thatthere's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The badnews is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn'tbecause of any "exclusivity" attempt, but simply because there is no"DoD store" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done byindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure issomeone says "I'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they'll cost$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?" Thenorders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover thepre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want aDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Orproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after allthis is anarchy in action.Here's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (andperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),motorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), andpatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) bypopular demand].All "profits" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist AssociationMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has beencontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,you'll see a large plaque on the Founders' Wall in the name of "Denizensof Doom, USENET, The World", complete with a DoD pin.Here's a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMTI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,the other day."Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:Congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and theDenizens of Doom!  With your recent donation, the total amount donated isnow $5,500.  On behalf of the AMHF, please extend my heartfeld gratitudeto all the membership of the Denizens.  The club's new plaque is presentlybeing prepared.  Of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to see the plaque that will be installed in our Founders Foyer.  By the way,I will personally mount a Denizens club pin on the plaque.  Again, thank you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, themuseum, and the fulfillment of its goals.

Updated stats & rec.motorcycles rides infoSome of the info cited above in various places tends to be a movingtarget. Rather than trying to catch every occurence, I'm just stickingthe latest info down here.Estimated rec.motorcycles readership: 35K  [news.groups]Approximate DoD Membership: 975  [KotL]DoD contributions to the American Motorcyclist Association MotorcycleHeritage Museum.

Rides:Summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its thirdyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Passtrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens gottogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far northas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains ofNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first GreatPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse forriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all havecome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]Also worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in theMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal2-strokes.  And though it's not an "official" (as if anything could beofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle racesin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for nettersto gather.  There's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.European Denizens have staged some gathers too.
