If societyaccepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame whenan innocent person gets executed.  Those that are not in favor shouldwork to convince others.And, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've consideredthe risk to be acceptable.  Similarly, every person who drives must acceptthe blame for fatal traffic accidents.  This is something that is surelygoing to happen when so many people are driving.  It is all a question ofwhat risk is acceptable.  It is much more likely that an innocent personwill be killed driving than it is that one will be executed.keith
