The will be a special focus in depictingthe effects of neurotransmitters on behavior.	Volotta Interactive Video is producing this project for Stanford University.We are currently in a pre-production phase and we are looking for data sets andvisualizations depicting brain function on the whole brain, neuron and molecularlevels.  We intend to use state-of-the-art visualization tools to renderinstructive visualizations from two-, three-, and four-dimensional data sets aswell as using already-completed visualizations to their best effect.	If you're interested in sharing your data for the purpose of education andsupporting the introductions of CD-ROM and scientific visualization technologiesinto our schools, please e-mail phughes@igc.org.
