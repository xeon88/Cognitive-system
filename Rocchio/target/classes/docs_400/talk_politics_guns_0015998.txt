The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred  : murder weapon, but ban them, and some other weapon will step in as the  : favorite.As a "favorite", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence inChicago produced this table:		Percentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks			    Resulting in Death	Weapon				Deaths As Percentage of Attacks	Knives (16,518 total attacks)		 2.4	Guns (6,350 total attacks)		12.2	Source: Firearms and Violence in American LifeIt might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of gunsthat they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this wereso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicidewould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks incities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would showa higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes andPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found thisnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knifeattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to theproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination onthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tendedto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do gravephysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about thehead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show thispattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment ofrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

Actually, I'm notfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans andAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economicdifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of foundmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  Idon't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violentcrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required everylaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are moreculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime ratesof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... citieswith roughly the same population, urban economy, geographyand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  Aftera 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealedweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reasonto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) areregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires arestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained inorder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handgunstransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.In short, gun control but not unreasonably so.Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions forgun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchersstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the samestandard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery inSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 inVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault inSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided byweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravatedassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms werefar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, ascompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rateof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) inSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due toa more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handgunsaccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handgunswere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle thanin Vancouver.The authors of the report also investigated "legally justifiable"homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred duringthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 inSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  Afterexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on theseearlier findings.This is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make theargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole becauseVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three timesthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reportsannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston.Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal accessto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide becausepersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire agun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more bythe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, wecould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns tobe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the studyinterval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than gunswas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting thatfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.As well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abidingcitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle didexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, thesecases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both citiesduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime categoryover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves forself-defense.
