>This thread brings up the more general question.  Can any crypto>implementation for which highly publicly scrutinized source code is not>available EVER be trusted?After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals,but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they should not; they should keep it proprietary. The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscombwas the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunatelyfor all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above questionmuch better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gainacceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessarycomplexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15 years.We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, inventedand proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined andvetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence byany of these.Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trustthe DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of thepublic scrutiny.(Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basisof authority alone.)We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can "break" theDES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time theycan "break" anything.  The important question is at what cost and inwhat time.The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so importantas what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand thecost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way.At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability ofany successor to overcome this knowledge gap.DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the centuryand the most important inventions in the history of cryptography.We are damned lucky to have them.William Hugh Murray, Executive Consultant, Information System Security49 Locust Avenue, Suite 104; New Canaan, Connecticut 06840                1-0-ATT-0-700-WMURRAY; WHMurray at DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL
