I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering mywife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last fewyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It'sdriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition isthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportionof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usuallyon Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, takingthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say"Crucify him" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do itagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were "invited" to sitduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian "invitation", I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seemstypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward themusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of theliturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to beexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're justsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is aboutto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay"experts", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has abias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact ofbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier forpeople to be aware of the Lord's presence.So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Massgoing down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday orFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregationalparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?John Murray
