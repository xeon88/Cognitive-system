The ATF agent interviewed on "Street Stories" reported that the raid wasill planned, and went ahead even when they (the BD's) knew the ATF was coming. WHY?I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it,and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit partin the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this thecontext of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda, as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proofmight be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requestsfor sufficient fire power. Important dates: Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.	   On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weaponban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senatein N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to havean Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons statedagenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or somegroup with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initiallyat the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent on "Street Stories" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to "get ready fast", as "they know we are coming". I believe this attack continued, even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top down. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time tocome up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely....rich
