Regarding David Wilkerson's prophecies.  While I'm not real sure ofhis credibility, I do remember a book he wrote, called A VISION orsomething like that.  He made a prediction that people who bought goldwould be hurt financially.  At the time, gold was up to about $800;now it is less than half that.  This prediction stuck in my mindbecause a lot of people where I worked were buying gold.The problem is, we tend to remember predictions that come true andforget ones that didn't (a la Jean Dixon).  Does anyone know if thereany of his predictions, perhaps from the book I mentioned, that canpretty definitely be said to have not come true?-Fred Gilham    gilham@csl.sri.com"Peace is only better than war when it's not hell too.
