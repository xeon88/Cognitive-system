I'm looking for a replacement radio/tape player for a 1984 Toyota Tercel.  Standard off-the-shelf unit is fine, but every place I've gone to (Service Merchandise, etc.) doesn't have my car in its model application book.  I want to just take out the old radio, and slide in the new, with minimal timespent hooking it up and adjusting the dashboard.If you have put in a new unit in a similar car, I'd like to hearwhat brand,  how easy it was to do the change, and any other relevant information. Please answer via E-mail.Thanks,  Tom OstrandTom Ostrand			E-mail:  tjo@scr.siemens.comSiemens Corporate Research	Phone:   609-734-6569755 College Road East		FAX:     609-734-6565Princeton, NJ  08540-6668
