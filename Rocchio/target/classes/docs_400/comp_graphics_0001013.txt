I am currently looking for a 3D graphics library that runs on MSWindows 3.1.  Are there any such libraries out there other thanVisuallib?  (It must run on VGA and should not require any otheradd-on graphics cards).For Visuallib, will it run with Metaware High C compiler v3.0?  Anyemail contact for the author of Visuallib?Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks.* Chua, Teck Joo	    | Information Technology Institute ** Email: teckjoo@iti.gov.sg | 71 Science Park Drive	       ** Phone: (65) 772-0237 	    | Singapore (0511)		       ** Fax:   (65) 779-1827      |			   	       *
