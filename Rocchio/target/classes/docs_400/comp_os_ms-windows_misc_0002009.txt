Using a Windows 3.1 printer driver, I would like to "print to a file", withoutput as a Postscript file.  Later, I would like to take this Postscript fileto a machine with an attached Hewlett Packard 4M laser printer, and print thedocument at 600 dots per inch resolution.I would like to use this method to print from WordPerfect For Windows, and froman image processing program that can output images in Postscript.Here's the problem:  the Windows Postscript printer driver (pscript.drv)doesn't allow me to specify 600 dpi.  In fact, the setup dialog for this driverdoes have a pull-down menu for "resolution", but the only choice given in themenu is 300!  Not a really useful menu.Any ideas?David Arnsteinarnstein@iis.sun.comInternational Imaging SystemsMilpitas, California
