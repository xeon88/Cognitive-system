Some people really have heard God, and othersheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  Hesaid someone told him, "The Lord gave me a song."  He said that it wasthe worst song he had ever heard."I know why he gave you that song," Murillo said, "He didn't want it anymore."But God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to theidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spiritin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the firstto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the onewe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an "M" whoprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecyhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other propheciesbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, "He never prophesiesanything good about me."  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two ofAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophetbefore he gave them.  So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it Scripture.  >Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new>but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call>that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn't that be more having to do with>knowledge?I don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets propheciesin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, "And his bishoprick let anothertake" concerning Judas office.A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying aboutwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joelabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scripturalprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdomcan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are oftenconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a bit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able tolabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the Spirit, and use them according to His leading.Link Hudson.
