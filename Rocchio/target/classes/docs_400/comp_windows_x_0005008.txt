I'm writing 'xwall', a simple X version of 'wall', and I want it toput a message up on each of a default list of displays.  The problemis that XOpenDisplay hangs if one of the displays is currentlycontrolled by xdm (login screen).   I've been through the manualsand FAQ and don't see a simple way to see if a display is 'openable'ahead of time, or to get XOpenDisplay to fail after a short periodof time.  Any hints, suggestions, clues, or pointers to info?
