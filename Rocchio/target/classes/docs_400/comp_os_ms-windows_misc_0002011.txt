I have been posting monthly "how-to-setup a SLIP client on a PC" posts for a few months.  Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of posting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize.This file includes information on writing a script for University of MinnesotaPHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with For additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at<ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu>Best wishes,Ashok-- begin SLIP.TXT --Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows,  hereare my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment.  I thank theTrumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments.Configuring your Modem:a) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W)   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use   to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program   and therefore hangs up the line.  If you use a program like Kermit   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done.   These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.   NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a         SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR.b) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first.  This can be done   automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of   Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the   SLIP packet driver.  The PHONE scripting language is simple and   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with   other SLIP server.  In addition, while the only packet driver   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers.   There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and   batch file examples.Configuring the SLIP drivers:There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly availableCSLIPPER.EXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driverSLIPPER.EXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driverSLIP8250.COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver)ETHERSL.COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP)UMSLIP.COM      Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250)Of these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM orETHERSL.COM for the following reasons:a) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UARTb) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a   long FTP transfer.c) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation moded) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with   every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with.Instructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE)a) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions:   For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1   slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600b) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the   double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual   packet driver at 0x60.  DOS applications in native mode, DOS   applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all   use this virtual driver at 0x60.   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62c) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next.  QVT/net is configured in   QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60.   pktint.comInstructions for SLIP8250.COM:a) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver.  Philip Burns of Northwestern   University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware   handshaking.  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP.b) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection.  My modem is a   V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver.   slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600c) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x   DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62d) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM   pktint.comInstructions for ETHERSL.COM:If you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, theinstructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference.  Youwill have to DELETE the line "device=*vcd" from the [386Enh] sectionof SYSTEM.INI.  This will interfere with running regular Windows Commapplications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of droppedcharacters etc. in these applications.  This is therefore notrecommended.  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as:   ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600Configuring Windows 3.1:a) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh]   section.   i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts.       COM1Base=03F8       COM2Base=02F8       COM3Base=03E8       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel,       but double-clicking on the "Ports" icon.   ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer       COM1Buffer=10000   iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish       to use for your modem to ZERO.  This is the amount of time that       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to       another application.  If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch       from one session to another, and this value is at the default value       of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash.       COM1AutoAssign=0       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel.       Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under "Device Contention", set       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to       "Never Warn"Additional notes:What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for eachSLIP session?I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each usera permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INIeach time that I establish a SLIP connection.If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in,please try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do theconfiguration for you.  However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARPwill not work over a SLIP connection.  To get QVTNet working in asituation such as this, you must do the following:Edit the QVTNET.INI file.  Let the [net] section look like this:[net]name=ip=netmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)arptime=20packet_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate)Save the changes, and then *write-protect* this file"attrib +r qvtnet.ini"Start your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP addressthat you are assigned.  Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, thegeneral configuration dialog box will open.  Enter the name andIP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK],and you should be up and running.  The changes you make will notbe saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected.A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP addressassignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)Victor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation.Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to afile called "myip".  Another file "noip" is essentially a completeQVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address.  In the final step "myip"and "noip" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file.  An example ofVictor's batch file is provided below:slipper com2pktint.combootpq -i "ip=\"%%s\""  >> myipbootpq -i "My IP# is: %s"copy /q net + myip + noip e:\com\qvtnet\qvtnet.inidel /q myip@echo offecho .echo Ready to run WinQVTnetFor questions and more details about bootpq, please contact VictorMenayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net.How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP?PKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashesimmediately if used with ETHERSL.COMPKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernetsimulation mode.  An example of this configuration is shown below:The latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that youuse this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers withapplications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly).[from AUTOEXEC.BAT]lh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver)lh pktmux 5 65 /5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)lh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net)lh pktint.com           (QVT/net pktint.com)pktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet)Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from withinWindows 3.1 DOS boxes.  For example, my PIF file to load POPmail isdirected to the file "popmail.bat".  This is what popmail.bat readslike:pktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60cd \popmailpopmailpktdrv 60 /u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60exit                    causes the DOS window to closeI have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applicationslike PC Gopher.  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fineeven if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOSsessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt.  For examplewithin two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other forGopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in eachinstance.How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER?I have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 witha reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra).  Under theseconditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded andbeing used as follows:a) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client sessionb) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 sessionc) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOSI get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferringcompressed files.  This rate is comparable to that which I get withSLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP sessionis active.  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single sessionis active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the samefiles.While there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER,for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh theperformance hit.C/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation modeIn ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all theapplications that I have tested it with.  One or two applicationsthat required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but eventhese rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX,I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads"IP:incorrect packet type" or "IP:bad version number".  This does notseem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment onloss of performance.What can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work withC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode?In the rare event that you find a package that does not work withC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author --Peter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let himknow.  Chances are that he can fix it.In the meanwhile, you can try the following.  I do not know if it iskosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2(C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section)I load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminateThis also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes.  However apacket driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS boxat a time.So for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (amedical reference retrieval program developed at the National Libraryof Medicine).ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIPsearchtermin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIPexit            closes the DOS box and returns me to WindowsIf you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't haveany active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time.  After closingthe ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with noproblem.  BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with noproblems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.3PHONE Script Files:The documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions onwriting script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other thanthe University of Minnesota server.  For example here is a scriptthat I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend.Background:  To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server,and login with a username and password.  After doing so, I start a SLIPsession with the following command "slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu",followed by my password -- again.Here then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file -# CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script by Ashok Aiyar 3/26/93# Last revised 3/28/93Procedure    Host.CWRU.LoginTimeOut 60      'CWRU-TS2 terminal server is not responding'Message         "CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script -- Version 1.1"Message         'Waiting for SLIP server to respond'Quiet ONExpect 'Verification'Message         'Request for User Verification Received from CWRU-TS2'Message         'Sending your user name and password'Quiet OFFExpect   'Username:'Send '%u<'Expect   'Password:'PrivateSend '%p<'Reject    'Access denied'   'Your user name or password was not accepted'TimeOut 30    'SLIP server did not respond to your validation request'Expect 'CWRU-TS2>'Send 'SLIP<'TimeOut 10    'SLIP server did not respond to SLIP command'Expect 'IP hostname or address:'Send '%u-slip.dialin.cwru.edu<'TimeOut 10 'SLIP server did not respond to hostname'Reject    'Bad IP address'   'Incorrect Hostname'Expect 'Password:'Send '%p<'Reject    'Access denied'    'Password not accepted.'TimeOut 10Expect 'Header Compression will match your system'Message 'Login to CWRU SLIP server successful'Wait 1.0EndProcedure   Host.CWRU.LoginProcedure      Host.CWRU.LogOut# Nothing special needs to be done to logoutEndProcedure   Host.CWRU.LogOut#   End of Script fileHow to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE?The quick answer -- there is no "clean" way.  Below is a batch filehack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In thisexample, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER.  To use abatch file like this, you must know the parameters with which youplan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate,port address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM,CSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directoryor in your path ...All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connectionusing PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup theconnection, and unload the driver when you are done ...-- being CWRUSLIP.BAT --@echo offrem   this batch file is an ugly hack of U. of Minn.
