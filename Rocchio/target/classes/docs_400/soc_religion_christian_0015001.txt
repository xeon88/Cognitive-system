Hi...I'm new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already,but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on theenvironment being turned (unintentionally, of course) intopantheism?I've debated this quite a bit, and while I think a legitimateconcern for the planet is a great thing, I can easily see itbeing perverted into something dangerous.As evidence, may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (of allthings!), April 2 (Editorial page):"We suspect that's because one party to the (environmental)dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified.  It's clear that muchof the environmentalist energy is derived from what has beencalled the Religious Left, a SECULAR, or even PAGAN fanaticismthat now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with areverence formerly accorded real religions."  (EMPHASIS MINE).Thoughts?  Reactions?  Harangues?
