There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid.  I thoughtI'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant.  I splurgedand let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; thehighest-paid player is Frank Thomas, at $900K.  I cut some players, likeKenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunchof pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at acost of $1 million for the lot of them.  The total team salary is $7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300K a player.  If that's too steep,you can dump Thomas and Bagwell, replacing them with Paul Sorrento anda minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have oneof the best teams in the majors.p, Juan Guzman, 500p, Mussina,	400p, Castillo,    250p, Eldred,      175p, Rhodes,	155p, Militello,   118rp, Rojas,	300rp, Beck,	250rp, Melendez,   235rp, Hernandez,	185rp, Nied,	150c, Rodriguez,	275c, Piazza,      1261b, Thomas,	9001b, Bagwell,    6552b, Knoblauch,	5002b, Barberie,	1903b, Gomez,	312.53b, Palmer,	250ss, Listach,	350ss, Pena,	170lf, Gonzalez,	525cf, Lankford,	290rf, R.Sanders,	275of, Plantier,	245ted frank                 | "However Teel should have mentioned that though thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu |  his advice is legally sound, if you follow it the u of c law school     |  you will probably wind up in jail."standard disclaimers      |                    -- James Donald, in misc.legal
