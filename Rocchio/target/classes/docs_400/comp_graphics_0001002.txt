The programmes are all a bit buggy anddefinitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are verywell written. The interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once youfigure out the tricks.I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morphwithout using the splines option.  Not sure why, since I don't havethe source.  I think it was written for TP 6.0.If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first timejust to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then it would work...>jna8182@usl.edu-Ryanrap@cis.ufl.edu
