My wife has one of these.  I have not had much chance to fiddle withit, but in comparison to our Laserwriters with Canon engines, shecomplains that the print is too light for her taste.  The differenceis quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select 310 isadjusted to the darkest possible level.  I don't find itobjectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that somepeople don't care for it and it is considerably different. I recall that years ago there were lots of debates over write-blackvs. write-white engines when dealing with TeX drivers.  Is somethinglike that going on here?
