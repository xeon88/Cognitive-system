But with some mechanicalaptitude of your own, and finding a good indi mechanic, you can avoid mostbreakdowns, and make the rest cheap(The sum total of the repairs on the car with195,000 miles has been 2 mufflers and a radiator. Whoa. Bad repair record). And all of these cars are driven fairly hard. None of them are at the head ofa line of cars going 30 MPH....the first two spend a lot of their operatinglife with the speedometer pegged...and the only reason the 84 doesn't is it hasa 120 MPH speedo...What I want to know is....have all you people who hate Volvos been traumatizedby someone in a 745 Turbo wagon blowing you away on the road, or what?
